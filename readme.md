Some notes for myself:

## 🛠️ Setup for GitHub Pages

1.  **Repository Name:** The site files (`index.html` and `style.css`) are in the root directory.
2.  **GitHub Pages Settings:** Go to your repository **Settings** $\rightarrow$ **Pages**.
3.  **Source:** Select **Deploy from a branch** and choose the **`main`** branch (or `master`) and the `/root` folder.
4.  **Save:** The site will build and be live shortly.

## 🔗 Custom Domain Setup

To use a custom domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`):

1.  In the GitHub Pages settings, enter your custom domain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`) in the **Custom domain** field and click **Save**.
2.  Go to your **Domain Registrar** (the company you bought the domain from, e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap).
3.  Create the necessary **DNS records** as instructed by GitHub (usually `A` records and a `CNAME` record).
