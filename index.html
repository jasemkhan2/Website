            <h2>ðŸ‘‹ <b>About Me</b></h2>
            <p>I'm an XR designer, game developer and creative technologist specializing in immersive experiences that blur the line between digital and physical worlds. Iâ€™ve completed a graduate degree in Information Technology spec. Gaming, AR and VR at Algoma University, with hands-on experience building games and experiences for Console, VR, MR, and real-time 3D.
			I design virtual worlds that arenâ€™t just seen, theyâ€™re felt. From high-intensity VR sports simulations to psychological experiences where motion itself is a mechanic, I love exploring how space, sound, interaction, and story come together in immersive design.<br><br>

ðŸ§  <b>What I focus on:</b>
<br>Spatial storytelling & user experience in VR/MR
<br>Interaction systems, Blueprint/C# scripting & custom mechanics
<br>Real-time 3D environments (Unreal Engine, Unity, Twinmotion, Spatial.io)
<br>Performance-aware design for Oculus/Meta Quest & WebXR
<br>Collaborative prototyping with cross-functional teams<br><br>

Iâ€™ve built projects ranging from Olympic VR games to ambient tension-based simulations to confidential Spatial.io experiences; all with an eye toward emotion, interaction, and impact.
If you're building something in XR, immersive media, or creative tech, let's connect. Iâ€™m always up for pushing boundaries, one headset at a time!<br><br>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, going to the gym, and exploring restaurants & cafes around Toronto.
